VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SCRIPT - TASK MANAGEMENT APPLICATION
=======================================================

INTRODUCTION
-----------
"Today I'll walk you through our task management application built with Flask backend and React frontend. This is a full-stack application with features for creating, managing, and tracking tasks."

PROJECT STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
--------------------------
"The project is organized into two main parts: backend and frontend, both located in the src/apps directory."

BACKEND STRUCTURE (Python/Flask)
--------------------------------
"Let's start with the backend, located in src/apps/backend."

"First, the server entry point - server.py. This is where the Flask application starts."

"The core business logic is in the modules folder. We have a task module that handles all task-related operations."

"Inside modules/task, we have:
- types.py - defines all data structures and parameters
- task_service.py - the service layer that orchestrates operations
- rest_api/task_view.py - the API endpoints for HTTP requests
- rest_api/task_router.py - routes configuration
- internal/task_reader.py - reads tasks from database
- internal/task_writer.py - writes tasks to database
- internal/task_util.py - utility functions for data conversion"

"The key feature we added is the active parameter. Tasks can be active (true) or completed (false). When you mark a task as done, we set active to false instead of deleting it."

"In task_reader.py, you can see we filter tasks by the active parameter. The get_paginated_tasks method accepts an active parameter to filter results."

"In task_writer.py, we have the mark_task_as_done method that sets active to false when a task is completed."

"The API endpoint in task_view.py supports querying with ?active=true or ?active=false to get active or completed tasks separately."

FRONTEND STRUCTURE (React/TypeScript)
-------------------------------------
"Now let's look at the frontend, located in src/apps/frontend."

"Pages folder contains our main views:
- dashboard/index.tsx - shows task statistics and recent tasks
- tasks/index.tsx - displays all active tasks with create, edit, delete, and mark as done
- completed-tasks/index.tsx - shows all completed tasks"

"Components folder has reusable UI components:
- task-card/index.tsx - displays individual task cards with status indicators
- sidebar/index.tsx - navigation menu
- task-form-modal/index.tsx - modal for creating/editing tasks"

"Services folder contains API clients:
- task.service.ts - handles all API calls to the backend, including the new markTaskAsDone method"

"Types folder defines TypeScript interfaces:
- task.ts - Task interface now includes the active field"

KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
-----------------------
"Let me show you the key features we implemented:"

"1. Task Management:
   - Create new tasks with title and description
   - Edit existing tasks
   - Delete tasks
   - Mark tasks as done (sets active to false)"

"2. Completed Tasks Page:
   - Separate page showing all completed tasks
   - Search and sort functionality
   - Can permanently delete completed tasks"

"3. Dashboard:
   - Shows total tasks, active tasks, and completed tasks count
   - Progress bars showing active vs completed percentages
   - Completion rate calculation
   - Recent tasks preview"

"4. Task Cards:
   - Visual status indicators (Active with pulsing dot, Completed with green dot)
   - Mark as Done button for active tasks
   - Edit and Delete buttons
   - Different styling for completed tasks"

"5. Sidebar Navigation:
   - Dashboard icon
   - Tasks icon
   - Completed Tasks icon (star/badge icon)"

HOW IT WORKS
-----------
"When you create a task, it's saved with active=true by default."

"When you click 'Mark as Done', it calls the markTaskAsDone API which sets active=false."

"The tasks page filters for active=true tasks, while the completed tasks page filters for active=false."

"The dashboard loads both counts to show statistics and progress."

ROUTING
-------
"Routes are defined in routes/protected.tsx:
- / - Dashboard
- /tasks - Active tasks page
- /tasks/completed - Completed tasks page"

STYLING
-------
"We use Tailwind CSS for styling. The tailwind.config.js file includes custom animations like fadeIn for smooth card appearances."

ASSETS
------
"Icons are stored in src/assets/img/icon. We use inline SVGs in the sidebar for better performance and theming support."

CONCLUSION
----------
"This application demonstrates a complete CRUD system with status tracking. The active flag pattern allows us to soft-delete tasks and maintain a history of completed work."

"The codebase follows a clean architecture with separation of concerns - API layer, service layer, and data access layer in the backend, and component-based architecture in the frontend."
